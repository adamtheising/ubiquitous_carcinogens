Additional metadata from .csv file: In the Listing Mechanism column, "AB" denotes authoritative bodies, "SQE" denotes State's Qualified Experts, "FR" denotes formally required to be labeled or identified, and "LC" denotes Labor Code. For those chemicals for which the basis for listing documentation is available electronically, a hyperlink to the documentation is provided. The identification number indicated in the following list is the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number. No CAS number is given when several substances are presented as a single listing. The date refers to the initial appearance of the chemical on the list. For those chemicals for which a no significant risk level (NSRL) for carcinogens or maximum allowable dose level (MADL) for reproductive toxicants has been adopted, it is denoted in the column, "NSRL or MADL." For those NSRLs or MADLs for which the risk assessment documentation is available electronically, a hyperlink to the documentation is provided.

"NTP_ROC15.csv": 15th Report on Carcinogens, released 12/21/2021. Downloaded 2/28/2024 from https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/content/roc15_casrn_index.xlsx and converted to csv. Additional metadata from .xlsx file: This Excel file contains a list of Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CAS #s) of listed substances for which a CAS number is available, and also indicates those substances listed in the Report on Carcinogens for which no CAS # could be identified. The listing status for each substance, i.e., Known to be a Human Carcinogen (Known) or Reasonably Anticipated to be a Human Carcinogen (RAHC), is indicated in the third column.
